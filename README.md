## Concept

<br>

## User Story
✅ Acceptance Criteria <br>
💻 GIVEN I am on the website. <br>
🖥 WHEN I type in the search bar, if the value is not an alphabetical letter. <br> 
✅ THEN An error modal pops up when we hit “enter”. <br>
🖥  WHEN  I start typing the player’s name and click the search button. <br>
✅ THEN I am presented with the players information and data. <br> 
🖥  WHEN I click the search button. <br>
✅ THEN I am presented with a giffy image of that player. <br>
🖥  WHEN I click the “save” button for the player information. <br>
✅ THEN It will save to local storage of that player. <br>

## Process
🚨 NBA stats API, GIFY API, Bulma framework <br>
🚨 Christian Lopez & Mike Serafin - HTML (Structuring) <br> 
🚨 Fitim Tahiraj & Yanming Cai - CSS (Styling) <br>
🚨 All of us will contribute to the script and API calls. <br>

## Challenges

❓ Working with Bulma to style the website <br>
❓ Making sure APIs work <br>
❓ Appending data from APIs to website <br>

## Successes
