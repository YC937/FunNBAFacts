## Concept
🎯 Fun User Interactive website. <br> 🎯 We LIKE basketball games and players!
<br>

## User Story
✅ Acceptance Criteria <br>
💻 GIVEN I am on the website. <br>
🖥 WHEN I type in the search bar, if the value is not an alphabetical letter. <br> 
✅ THEN An error modal pops up when we hit “enter”. <br>
🖥  WHEN  I start typing the player’s name and click the search button. <br>
✅ THEN I am presented with the players information and data. <br> 
🖥  WHEN I click the search button. <br>
✅ THEN I am presented with a giffy image of that player. <br>
🖥  WHEN I click the “save” button for the player information. <br>
✅ THEN It will save to local storage of that player. <br>

## Process
🚨 NBA stats API, GIFY API, Bulma framework <br>
🚨 Christian Lopez & Mike Serafin - HTML (Structuring) <br> 
🚨 Fitim Tahiraj & Yanming Cai - CSS (Styling) <br>
🚨 All of us will contribute to the script and API calls. <br>

## Challenges
❓ Creating a proper index HTML file with a correct framework <br>
❓ Working with Bulma to style the website <br>
❓ Making sure APIs work <br>
❓ Appending data from APIs to website <br>
❓ Creating local storage <br>
❓ Creating user-friendly buttons without any errors <br>
❓ Creating modal for feedback <br>

## Successes
✅ API calls work <br>
✅ Website with data appended successfully <br>
✅ Every button created works <br>
✅ GIFY API works well <br>
✅ Website on github deployed successfully! <br>

## Directions for Future Development
🚀 Create API data for feedback collection <br>
🚀 Find another API with retired NBA players’ info <br>
🚀 Add another Nav bar modal that allows user to change the seasons <br>
